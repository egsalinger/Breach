Breach
======

This is a game idea I've been playing with. I'm intentionally making different portions of the game in different languages to have fun.

The basic idea is as follows: A tactical team needs to enter a house. There are some number of Enemies, some number of Hostages, and some number of Civilians. The player has a map of the area to breach, and must order units through the house, to clear it. Each round ends when the entire house is explored.

Currently, the plan is to generate a random house generator using Python, and then a front-end game interface using Java.

I may add a mobile front end at a later point in time. House size starts small-ish but can increase over time.
